**Minion** is a high-performance **derivative-free optimization** library designed for solving complex optimization problems where gradients are unavailable or unreliable. It features **state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms**, including top-performing methods from IEEE CEC competitions, which are not commonly found in standard optimization libraries such as SciPy, NLopt, OptimLib, pyGMO, and pagmo2.

Minion also serves as a **research platform** for developing and testing new optimization algorithms. It includes benchmark functions from **CEC competitions (2011, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2022)**, providing a robust framework for algorithm evaluation and comparison.
