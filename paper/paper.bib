abstract = {Since its inception in 1995, Differential Evolution (DE) has emerged as one of the most frequently used algorithms for solving complex optimization problems. Its flexibility and versatility have prompted several customized variants of DE for solving a variety of real life and test problems. The present study, surveys the near 25 years of existence of DE. In this extensive survey, 283 research articles have been covered and the journey of DE is shown through its basic aspects like population generation, mutation schemes, crossover schemes, variation in parameters and hybridized variants along with various successful applications of DE. This study also provides some key bibliometric indicators like highly cited papers having citations more than 500, publication trend since 1996, journal citations etc. The main aim of the present document is to serve as an extended summary of 25 years of existence of DE, intended for dissemination to interested parties. It is expected that the present survey would generate interest among the new users towards the philosophy of DE and would also guide the experience researchers.}

	abstract = {Various benchmark sets have already been proposed to facilitate comparison between metaheuristics, or Evolutionary Algorithms. During the competition, typically algorithms are allowed either to run until the allowed number of function calls is exhausted (and one compares the quality of solutions found), or until a required objective function value is obtained (one compares the speed in reaching the required solution). During the last 20 years several problem sets were defined using the first approach. In this study, we test 73 optimization algorithms proposed between the 1960′s and 2022 on nine competitions based on four sets of problems (CEC 2011, CEC 2014, CEC 2017, and CEC 2020) with different dimensionalities. We intend to test the original versions of 73 algorithms “as they are”, with control parameters proposed by the authors of the particular method. The recent benchmark set, CEC 2020, includes fewer problems and allows much more function calls than the former sets. As a result, one group of algorithms perform best on older, a different one on the more recent (CEC 2020) benchmark sets. Almost all algorithms that perform best on CEC 2020 set achieve moderate-to-poor performance on older sets, including real-world problems from CEC 2011. Algorithms that perform best on older sets are more flexible than those that perform best on CEC 2020 benchmark. The choice of the benchmark may have a crucial impact on the final ranking of algorithms. The lack of tuning may affect the results that were obtained in this study, hence it is highly recommended to repeat a similar large-scale comparison with control parameters of each algorithm tuned, best by different methods, separately for each benchmark set.}

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

abstract = {We propose a multistart CMA-ES with equal budgets for two interlaced restart strategies, one with an increasing population size and one with varying small population sizes. This BI-population CMA-ES is benchmarked on the BBOB-2009 noiseless function testbed and could solve 23, 22 and 20 functions out of 24 in search space dimensions 10, 20 and 40, respectively, within a budget of less than $10^6 D$ function evaluations per trial.},
