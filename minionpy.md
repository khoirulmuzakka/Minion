MinionPy is the Python implementation of the Minion C++ library, designed for derivative-free optimization. It provides tools for solving optimization problems where gradients are unavailable or unreliable, incorporating state-of-the-art algorithms recognized in IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) competitions. The library offers researchers and practitioners access to advanced optimization techniques and benchmarks for testing and evaluation.

## Features

- **Optimization Algorithms**  
    - **Differential Evolution-based algorithms:**
      - Basic Differential Evolution (DE)
      - JADE  
      - L-SHADE  
      - LSHADE-cnEpSin
      - jSO
      - j2020 
      - NL-SHADE-RSP 
      - LSRTDE 
      - ARRDE *(Adaptive Restart-Refine DE)*  
    - **Other population-based algorithms:**
      - Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
      - Grey Wolf DE Optimization  
      - Canonical PSO, SPSO-2011, Dynamic Multi-Swarm PSO (DMS-PSO)  
      - CMA-ES *(Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)*  
    - **Classical optimization algorithms:**
      - Nelder-Mead  
      - Generalized Simulated Annealing (Dual Annealing)  
      - L-BFGS-B (vectorized & noise-robust) 
      - L-BFGS (vectorized & noise-robust) 
      
- **Benchmark Support**  
  The library includes benchmark functions from the CEC competitions (2011, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2022), providing a standardized environment for algorithm development, testing, and comparison.

- **Performance**  
  Most implemented algorithms are population-based, making them suitable for parallelization. MinionPy is optimized for vectorized functions, enabling efficient use of multithreading and multiprocessing capabilities.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  MinionPy is implemented in C++ with a Python wrapper, supporting usage in both languages. It has been tested on the following platforms:
  - Windows 11
  - Linux Ubuntu 24.04
  - macOS Sequoia 15  

## Applications

MinionPy is applicable in scenarios where derivative-free optimization is required, including engineering, physics, and machine learning. Its standardized benchmarks and high-performance algorithms make it suitable for developing and evaluating new optimization techniques as well as solving real-world optimization problems.
